- *Squares are rounded up to the 1/3 of a square

Additional materials needed for ridge, hip, and starter lengths are not included in the above table. The provided suggested waste factor is intended to serve as a guide-actual waste percentages may differ based upon several variables that EagleView does not control. These waste factor variables include, but are not limited to, individual installation techniques, crew experiences, asphalt shingle material subtleties, and potential salvage from the site. Individual results may vary from suggested waste factor that EagleView has provided. The suggested waste is not to replace or substitute for experience or judgement as to any given replacement or repair work.
